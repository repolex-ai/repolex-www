Welcome to the Repolex technical blog.

This is where we'll share insights about:

- Semantic code intelligence and RDF knowledge graphs
- Neurosymbolic architectures for code understanding
- Ontology-driven development patterns
- Multi-modal AI tooling for software engineering

Stay tuned for deep dives into the architecture, research notes, and implementation details.

## What is Repolex?

Repolex transforms codebases into queryable semantic knowledge through advanced RDF graph analysis. Think of it as giving your code a brain that can reason about itself.
